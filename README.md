- 👋 Hi, I’m @kaligrey91
- 👀 When I'm coding it feels like time stops, it's like coding invests in me, like else is important but the work at hand.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, C++, Kali Linux (ethical hacking)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with persons with enthusiasm, passion and ambition about coding/programming.
